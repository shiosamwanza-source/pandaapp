# PANDA Database

We store business history — not money.

Tables we will likely need:

• users
• suppliers
• rfqs
• orders
• milestones
• verification_requests
• documents
• notifications
• audit_logs

Important:

❌ Do NOT store videos in database
✔ Store links only (example: Google Drive, S3, etc.)
