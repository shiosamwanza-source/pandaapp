# PANDA Backend

The backend will power the PANDA MVP.

We start very simple:

1️⃣ Authentication (login, users)
2️⃣ RFQs (Request for Quote)
3️⃣ Orders + timeline
4️⃣ Documents uploads (links only, not files in DB)
5️⃣ Live Verification scheduling (not video yet)

Important rule:

❌ No wallet
❌ No escrow
❌ No payments handling

We only store:

✔ data
✔ history
✔ proof
✔ organization
