This repository currently contains:

1) Early learning experiments (Go backend)
2) MVP planning and documentation
3) The foundation for the real MVP, which is now being organized.

The learning code is kept intentionally — NOT deleted — because
it shows history and may be useful later.

The new MVP structure will live in:

# PANDA — Trust-First Trading MVP

This repository contains the MVP concept for PANDA — a platform that helps buyers and suppliers trade more safely, without acting as a wallet, middle-man, or escrow.

PANDA is NOT another marketplace.

Instead, it organizes business activity:

✔ RFQs (Request for Quote)  
✔ Orders + milestones timeline  
✔ Document center (invoices, receipts, contracts)  
✔ Live Verification calls (evidence, transparency)  
✔ Notifications and reminders

Goal:

> Help people trade with proof, organization, and clarity — without touching their money.

## 📦 About This Repository

Right now the project is still being organized.

Some files here are from earlier learning (example: Golang backend).  
They are kept intentionally — NOT deleted — because they may help later.

The proper MVP structure will live in:
This is work-in-progress.

## 🔐 MVP Safety Rules

To reduce risk:

❌ No wallet  
❌ No escrow  
❌ No holding user funds  

Payments happen **outside the app**, exactly like people already do.

Instead PANDA focuses on:

✔ records  
✔ documents  
✔ proof  
✔ live verification  
✔ transparency

## 🚀 Vision (future)

Later — when the MVP proves value:

• Safer payments  
• Automated disputes  
• Supplier verification partners  

But not now. Discipline first.
